## vtkLegendScaleActor improvements

vtkLegendScaleActor has been improved in several ways:
- The axes appearance can be configured using a vtkProperty2D
- In non-adjusted mode, the number of horizontal and vertical ticks can be configured
- Label values can be formatted using fixed-point or scientific notation in addition to the default formatting
