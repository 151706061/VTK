## Improve box widget/representation

The box widget can now be rotated along a single axis, by holding x, y, or z key (desired axis) while rotating the box with Left-Click (unchanged).

The scaling interaction has also been corrected an improved. While holding Right-Click (unchanged) to rescale,
moving away from the center of the widget scales up, and moving towards the center scales down.
