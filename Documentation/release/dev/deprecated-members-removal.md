## Deprecated Members Removal

Some protected variable members were deprecated and unused anymore. They are now removed. This concerns:
- vtkHyperTreeGridThreshold::JustCreateNewMask
- vtkTemporalAlgorithm::RunBackward

Their getters and setters were already removed during an usual deprecation process.
