# Rules for where jobs can run

###
## Job variables:
##   VTK_CI_RUN_ALWAYS
##     Set to "true" if the job should always run.
##   VTK_CI_RUN_MANUALLY
##     Set to "true" if the job should be manually triggered in MRs. These jobs
##     will also be delayed for branch update pipelines
##   VTK_CI_MERGED_ONLY
##     Set to "true" to make the job only run for merged pipelines.
##   VTK_CI_NIGHTLY_ONLY
##     Set to "true" if the job should only run for nightly pipelines.
##   VTK_CI_RELEASE_ONLY
##     Set to "true" if the job should only run for release pipelines.
##   VTK_CI_DOCUMENTATION_UPLOAD
##     Set to "true" if the job uploads documentation.
##   VTK_CI_WEEKLY_UPLOAD
##     Set to "true" if the job performs a weekly upload.
## Pipeline variables:
##   ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION_UPLOAD
##     Set to "true" when documentation upload jobs should be performed.
##   ENABLE_WEEKLY_UPLOAD
##     Set to "true" when weekly upload jobs should be performed.
